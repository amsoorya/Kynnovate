# Kynnovate Project

## Description
This project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`kynnovate.ipynb`). It integrates natural language processing, personalized recommendation systems, geospatial data analysis, and user interaction learning to provide a comprehensive event discovery platform. Key functionalities include:
- Processing natural language queries to identify user intent and entities.
- Offering personalized event recommendations based on user preferences and interactions.
- Supporting location-based discovery of nearby events.
- Adapting recommendations dynamically based on user feedback.

## Features
### 1. Process Natural Language Queries
**Requirement**: Interpret user queries like “Find yoga classes near me” and map them to relevant events.  
**Approach**:
- Use an NLP model (e.g., BERT, spaCy, GPT) to process user input.
- Key tasks:
  - **Intent Recognition**: Classify user intent (e.g., finding events, feedback submission).
  - **Entity Recognition**: Extract key entities like event types, locations, and dates.
- **Dataset Used**: Events dataset (for category mapping) and synthetic user queries for training/testing.

### 2. Provide Personalized Recommendations
**Requirement**: Recommend events based on user preferences and past interactions.  
**Approach**:
- Build a hybrid recommendation system:
  - **Collaborative Filtering (CF)**: Suggest events based on similar users' interactions using engagement data.
  - **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommend events similar to a user’s past preferences using event features like category, tags, and location.
- **ML Techniques**:
  - Matrix Factorization (e.g., SVD for CF).
  - TF-IDF or embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec) for content similarity.
  - Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) for advanced recommendations.
- **Dataset Used**: Users, engagements, and events datasets.

### 3. Support Location-Based Discovery
**Requirement**: Recommend events near a user's location.  
**Approach**:
- Use geospatial data to filter events:
  - Calculate distances between user and event locations using the Haversine formula.
  - Implement proximity-based filters with user-provided location or GPS coordinates.
- **ML Techniques**:
  - Clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to group events by region for faster queries.
- **Dataset Used**: Events dataset (location fields).

### 4. Learn from User Interactions
**Requirement**: Adapt recommendations based on user feedback.  
**Approach**:
- Implement reinforcement learning or continuous learning mechanisms:
  - Use feedback (e.g., clicks, likes, ratings) to improve recommendations.
  - Train a Bandit Algorithm (e.g., Thompson Sampling) to balance exploration of new events with exploitation of known preferences.
- Incorporate feedback into retraining pipelines for collaborative and content-based models.
- **Dataset Used**: Engagements dataset.
